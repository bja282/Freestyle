<b>Freestyle Project</b>: Real-Time MTA Service Updates<br>
Programming in Python<br>
Summer 2017<br>
Benjamin Alpert

The purpose of this program is to allow a user to check for real-time MTA subway service updates and confirm service and operations prior to entering a subway station, in order to plan for a commute or trip accordingly.

The program reads from the MTA's service update API using BeautifulSoup and then outputs information relevant to the user's selection.
